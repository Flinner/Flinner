2. What langs do prefer?  
I think the language itself isn't all that important, 
but I do like *functional* languages, typed or not. 

If I were to choose my favorite, I would choose:  
  - `Clojure`: lisp+JVM!, macros and a repl!
  - `Rust`: typed, static, zero-cost abstraction, friendly and helpful compiler
  - `Javascript`: (Mostly) Forced to love it as the I do web programming, I might try `clojurescript` :)
  - `Typescript`: Javascript but with types and a helpful compiler
3. Are these questions really FAQ (Frequently Asked)?  
No, I just made them up :(
